Pandas, Matplotlib and Statistical Analysis
-------

In the dataset 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

------
Data wrangling:
* The datasets are merged into a single DataFrame.
* The number of mice are shown from the merged DataFrame.
* Each duplicate mice is found based on the Mouse ID and Timepoint.
* A clean DataFrame is created with the dropped duplicate mice.
* The number of mice are shown from the clean DataFrame.

Generate Summary Statistics:
* The mean of the tumor volume for each regimen is calculated using groupby.
* The media of the tumor volume for each regimen is calculated using groupby.
* The variance of the tumor volume for each regimen is calculated using groupby.
* The standard deviation of the tumor volume for each regimen is calculated using groupby.
* The SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen is calculated using groupby.
* A new DataFrame is created with using the summary statistics.

Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts:
* A bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen using Pandas is generated.
* A bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen using pyplot is generated.
* A pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using Pandas is generated.
* A pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using pyplot is generated.

Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot:
* A DataFrame that has the last timepoint for each mouse ID is created using groupby.
* The index of the DataFrame is reset.
* Retrieve the maximum timepoint for each mouse.
* The four treatment groups, Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, are put in a list.
* An empty list is created to fill with tumor volume data.
* A for loop is used to display the interquartile range (IQR) and the outliers for each treatment group.
* A box plot is generated that shows the distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group.

Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot:
* A line plot is generated that shows the tumor volume vs. time point for one mouse treated with Capomulin.
* A scatter plot is generated that shows average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen.

Calculate Correlation and Regression:
* The correlation coefficient and linear regression model are calculated for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
